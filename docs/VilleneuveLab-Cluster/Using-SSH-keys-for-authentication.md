## _This step is optional_

This tutorial introduces you to set up properly passwordless connection to a remote cluster

SSH keys serve as a means of identifying yourself to an SSH server using public-key cryptography. One immediate advantage this method has over traditional password authentication is that you can be authenticated by the server without ever having to send your password over the network.

A very good tutorial exists on the scinet wiki (Ontario cluster)
